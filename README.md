# LolpickAngular

Revision of https://github.com/andrewsrahn/lolpick to angular because I use angular at work, want to seperate riotgames API calls into a seperate project, and want to develop with behavior driven design.  The previous application was developed without any end to end testing, integration tests, or unit tests.
